And there I go. Creating a simple app with `react-create-app` to test some nice tool, running `react-create-app my-nice-app` and boom!

```bash
-bash: gulp: command not found
```

## The problem
This happen because `npm` was installed in the wrong directory. The sadness üòû

If you look for the global install location, probably you will find it into `/Users/USERNAME/node_modules`. You can check this by running `npm root` or `npm root -g`.

## The solution
To fix it you need to change `npm config prefix` by running:

```bash
npm config set prefix /usr/local
```

Then reinstall `react-create-app`

```bash
npm i -g react-create-app
```

Now you can run `create-react-app my-nice-app` and be happy üòù
