title: How to delete a git tag locally and remote
tags:
  - git
---
Today I made a mistake of publishing a wrong `git` tag and I asked myself: What the fuck do I do now?

So I did some research and found [this gist](https://gist.github.com/mobilemind/7883996) from [mobilemind](https://gist.github.com/mobilemind).

# The solution

```sh
# to delete a local tag just run e.g.: v1.9.1
git tag -d v1.9.1

# if you already published (like me)
git tag -d v1.9.1
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.9.1

# another approach
git push --delete origin v1.9.1
git tag -d v1.9.1
```

# Conclusion

Always double-check before pushing something to remote ðŸ˜‚

Happy codding
