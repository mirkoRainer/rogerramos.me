Finally a more complete version of my website is _online_ and now I can log my daily learnings!

There so much things to be done yet, things like:

* Quote of the day
* What music is inspiring me on that day
* What book or cool article I'm reading
* Hero image with Post title

So many Thanks to [Rafael Fabeni](http://www.raphaelfabeni.com.br/), your Log repository has been my inspiration for this.

I learned so many things doing this website and on the next days I'll be posting here to share with everyone and soon I'll make this website repository public into Github ðŸ¥°.

Cheers!
